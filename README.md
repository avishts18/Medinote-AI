# MediNote-AI  
**Transforming Doctor-Patient Conversations into Automated Medical Reports with AI Precision.**

---

## 🚀 Overview
**MediNote-AI** is an AI-powered web application designed to streamline healthcare documentation by converting doctor-patient conversations into structured, comprehensive medical reports. By leveraging advanced speech-to-text technology and natural language processing (NLP) with models like **GPT-4**, MediNote-AI assists healthcare professionals in generating accurate prescriptions, dietary recommendations, and care instructions while storing data securely for future reference.  

This project was developed during **HackVerse 5.0** to empower doctors and medical institutions with a **smarter, faster, and error-free** approach to patient management.
